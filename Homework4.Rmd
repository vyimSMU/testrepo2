## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Write bootstrap code to illustrate the central limit theorem in R markdown 
#and push the result to GitHub. Use a normal distribution with two different 
#sample sizes and an exponential distribution with two different sample sizes. 
#Correct code alone is insufficient. Please also comment on the code and 
#explain the results. For help, see the lotsa.medians function in Unit 4. 
#The deliverable is a link to a GitHub repo containing the code.


#assuming a vector with 10 numbers that is normally distribution
x<-c(rnorm(10))

#using bootstap method to general the sample mean
sample(x,size=length(x),replace=T)
mean(x)
#repeat the process 10000 times
R<-10000
bootmean<-numeric(R)
for (i in 1:R){bootsample<-sample(x,size=length(x),replace=TRUE)
bootmean[i]<-mean(bootsample)
}


#histogram show a normal distribution of the 10000 means
hist(bootmean)

#assuming a vector with 20 numbers that is normally distribution
x<-c(rnorm(20))

#using bootstap method to general the sample mean
sample(x,size=length(x),replace=T)
mean(x)
#repeat the process 10000 times
R<-10000
bootmean<-numeric(R)
for (i in 1:R){bootsample<-sample(x,size=length(x),replace=TRUE)
bootmean[i]<-mean(bootsample)
}


#histogram show a normal distribution of the 10000 means
hist(bootmean)



#assuming a vector with 10 numbers with exponent of 3 that is normally distribution
x<-c(rnorm(10)^3)

#using bootstap method to general the sample mean
sample(x,size=length(x),replace=T)
mean(x)
#repeat the process 10000 times
R<-10000
bootmean<-numeric(R)
for (i in 1:R){bootsample<-sample(x,size=length(x),replace=TRUE)
bootmean[i]<-mean(bootsample)
}


#histogram show a normal distribution of the 10000 means
hist(bootmean)

#assuming a vector with 20 numbers with exponent of 2 that is normally distribution
x<-c(rnorm(20)^2)

#using bootstap method to general the sample mean
sample(x,size=length(x),replace=T)
mean(x)
#repeat the process 10000 times
R<-10000
bootmean<-numeric(R)
for (i in 1:R){bootsample<-sample(x,size=length(x),replace=TRUE)
bootmean[i]<-mean(bootsample)
}


#histogram show a normal distribution of the 10000 means
hist(bootmean)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
